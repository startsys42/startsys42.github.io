<h1>Startsys42 Events</h1>

<p>
The Startsys42 Events section is dedicated to organizing competitions, challenges, 
and experimental activities. These events can take place both digitally and in person. 
They cover a variety of domains, from robotics to cryptography, aiming to foster 
participation, learning, and the exploration of new ideas within the project.
</p>

<h2>Types of Events</h2>

<p>
Startsys42 events are structured into four main categories, based on the target audience 
and the type of participation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Events for collaborators:</strong> activities exclusively for project collaborators. 
    These events may be broadcast or shared publicly, but external participants are not allowed.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Custom events for external audiences:</strong> events designed for specific external 
    individuals or groups, tailored to their needs, with participation limited only to the intended audience.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Reward-based access events:</strong> events where participation is conditional 
    on previously earned rewards from other challenges, activities, or events. 
    These rewards function as an access system rather than as a final prize.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Public attendance events:</strong> events open to the general public, focused primarily 
    on enjoyment and experience. In some cases, registration or tickets may be required, 
    without necessarily implying active participation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Reward and Access System</h2>

<p>
The project includes a reward-based access system, conceived as an internal infrastructure 
similar to a virtual banking system. By participating in previous activities, users can earn 
different tokens or units of value that grant access to specific events.
</p>

<p>
These units do not represent final prizes but act as mechanisms to control access. Their value 
can fluctuate according to mathematical functions designed to simulate a dynamic system, 
and in case of unexpected behavior, values may be manually adjusted without negatively 
impacting participants.
</p>

<h2>Challenges and Technical Documentation</h2>

<p>
Developing challenges and technical activities is part of the project's experimentation process. 
These challenges may involve areas such as cryptography, logic, programming, distributed systems, 
or other technical domains, and serve to validate concepts and methodologies.
</p>

<p>
To implement these challenges, various technical approaches may be used, such as specific web platforms, 
automated tools, external services, messaging systems, or isolated environments designed for each case, 
depending on the event's objectives.
</p>

<p>
All results, analysis, and solutions will be progressively documented in the project wiki, 
which will compile technical notes, conceptual explanations, and useful references for study and experimentation.
</p>
