   <h1>What is Wild events?</h1>

<p>Wild events is the branch dedicated to creating and organizing events of various kinds.</p>


<h1>How to participate?</h1>
      <p>
<p>We want there to be four types of events for users. </p>
<ul><li>Designed for specific people and not everyone will be able to participate.</li>
<li>Public and anyone will be able to participate. </li> 
<li>Private, organized by and for us.</li>
<li>Public but based on rewards.</li>
</ul>


  </p> 

     <h1>Participation system for rewards</h1>
<p>We will create a database as a banking system. We will create a series of "coins" that can be obtained by solving problems or challenges. We will have control of creating and withdrawing a coin at any time without harming the users. 
But as in real life, coins rise and fall in value. To make this happen, we will design mathematical functions that vary the value of the coins. However, if these functions get out of control, we will adjust their value manually.</p>


<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>To launch the challenges, we will try to rely on technologies such as discord bots, real life, web pages as a game or trivial...</p>
<p>However, to see some clues of some challenges or documentation of some solved ones, you can consult the following link: <a href="challenges_en.html">Challenges</a></p>
