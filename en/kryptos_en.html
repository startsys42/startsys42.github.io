        <h1>Kryptos</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Kryptos is a sculpture by sculptor Jim Sanborn that has been installed in the CIA offices in Langley since 1990.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>K0</h3>
<p>The first thing to solve is the morse code or K0. Once solved, several things stand out.</p>
<p>The placement of the words, left to right and from top to bottom and from right to left and from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The e is the most used letter in English.</p>
<p>The existence of the palindrome in interpretation.</p>
<p>Morse itself, its structure and design. Playing with dots, two letters give rise to one. As GT forms Q. Also three dots form a line.</p>
<p>We forces e, which can be interpreted as f or c, w for c, e for c.</p>
<p>Digital, dig is to extract, if we remove a dot from the i in morse it becomes an e.</p>
<p>T is your position, tposition can mean transposition. Or t is y or t is your p. </p>
<p>SOS stresses the importance of Morse code.</p>
<p>RQ could mean request but also the radio codes RQ, back to Morse code.</p>
<p>The placement of T IS, SOS and RQ stands out, the pyramid they form. It should be noted that IOQ is vigen√®re, which will be seen later.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of letters e stands out, as if something had been extracted or moved back.</p>
