        <h1>Kryptos</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Kryptos is a sculpture by sculptor Jim Sanborn that has been installed in the CIA offices in Langley since 1990.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>K0</h3>
<p>The first thing to solve is the morse code or K0. Once solved, several things stand out.</p>
<p>The placement of the words, left to right and from top to bottom and from right to left and from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The e is the most used letter in English.</p>
<p>The existence of the palindrome in interpretation.</p>
<p>Morse itself, its structure and design. Playing with dots, two letters give rise to one. As GT forms Q. Also three dots form a line.</p>
<p>We forces e, which can be interpreted as f or c, w for c, e for c.</p>
<p>Digital, dig is to extract, if we remove a dot from the i in morse it becomes an e.</p>
<p>T is your position, tposition can mean transposition. Or t is y or t is your p. </p>
<p>SOS stresses the importance of Morse code.</p>
<p>RQ could mean request but also the radio codes RQ, back to Morse code.</p>
<p>The placement of T IS, SOS and RQ stands out, the pyramid they form. It should be noted that IOQ is vigenère, which will be seen later.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of letters e stands out, as if something had been extracted or moved back.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>In the sculpture it stands out that a vigenère table is shown, this table has an alphabet of 31 letters except for the letter N which has 32, 
             highlighting an L. The word he uses is kryptos, which means secret. It stands out that if we take 26 letters of the alphabet, the following ones are like reversing the meaning. 
             Although it shows this table, it is not the one used to decrypt K1 and K2. Note that the alphabet rotates (go back) one position in each letter.</p>
      <p> If we grouped the encrypted message from the letters END to the end into 14 rows of 31 characters we began to see things.</p>
      <p> The word END and DOT  appear. Below we see TWO, L-shaped OXO, AIR and KRSO(T)YP (kryptos) as indicating a transposition or change of order or direction. PGP also appears (Sanborn and the CIA knew
                    of its existence before being published?) and KR (private part) and KU (public part).</p>
    <p>We can see words like STEW, SITE (sitego, stego), HARD placed in column in the ciphertext and DIG. </p>
      <p>The grouping of 3 T vertically and the vertical XTT in the lower corner stands out.</p>
      <p>If we look closely at all the cipher text at the top and bottom we see a key but in the opposite direction. </p>

         <p><a href="https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/double-columnar-transposition/#">Online transposition tool</a></p>
      <p> In the upper left corner from the END we see ENDYAHR where the letters YA_R are raised. It can be read as HR A DY (hours in a day), as YEAR, as the initials of yellow, amber, red, or as a pattern.</p>
<h3>K3</h3>
         <p>In my opinion, this is the next fragment to decrypt. It is a transposition that goes from the E of the END to the last ?. First group the letters into rows with a total of 24 characters per row and
             then turns them counterclockwise. Next, form lines of 8 characters and turn again in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>The text is a fragment of Howard Carter's diary notes upon discovering Tutankhamun's tomb.</p>
         <p>If we calmly analyze the text, we see that it tries to tell us something more than a way to proceed. The text seems to be missing a letter E, has an extra Q and there is an A instead 
             of an E in DESPARATLY.</p>
      <p>It talks about removing debris from the bottom of the door, although doorway is door in English, it can also be portal, entrance or step. If we separate door (entrance) and way, way means by itself the form, the path or the mode or the manner.

Remains  can be interpreted as remain (remain, stay, be) (-S). Main means main, major, important or master (-S) and mains means electric network.</p>
      <p>Passage means the passage or the approval but if we separate pass (pass, approve, overcome, advance, the step) and age (time).

Encumber means to load, overload, encumber or engrave but (C-)umbered means numbered.

Breach means breach, to open a gap (verb), to infringe or infringement or non-compliance. Reach means reach, distance, extension or wingspan. But also reach(verb), arrive, encompass, lengthen or extend.
</p>

      <p> He may be telling us that there is debris or a mask between the correct encryption and the one we see that needs to be removed, he may be telling us how. Passing or giving it a pass. It may be possible for us from K2. These remains get in the way or overload or may indicate numbering. 
 We are also not very clear about what the bottom part is, perhaps the END.

         It can be read REACH IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER (extends in the corner of the left hand or perhaps tells us about the error of K1 or the end of K3) and H IN T (hint, hint). He talks about inserting the candle, and that the hot air coming out of the chamber made the flame flicker presenting the details of the room.

Talk about removing very slowly, cameras capture a moment of time, a state. But putting frames together we can see a sequence. Perhaps each letter of K4 must be drawn in a specific state, so that a series of intertwined states is traversed.</p>
 <p>
         Hot air is  O2 which is CO2, flashes like YA_R (a pattern or traffic light or the time in a year or day?), details contains tail. It is also seen that in the K3 ciphertext in the upper corner END,AC,T as candle. Perhaps the L in the vigenere table is related to K3 or K1. In my mind, 
             fits place YA_R + candle =calendar. </p>
        <p>DETAILS OF THE ROOM WITHIN EMERGED FROM THE MIST X, can be read as he lost T (although losing in English is miss) or united (merge, merge, join) for the lost T.</p>
         <p> Note that CHAMBER has amber, PEERED has red. ENCUMBERED has a network.</p>
               <p> Although more information can be obtained from K3 that we will analyze later, let's go to the last two of relevance for now. The final question whose real answer according to the book was "wonderful things" and
                   according to the field notes "Yes, it is wonderful." Is Jim asking us about Qs? or is it is w important? Should we respond (rq=request?)? </p>
         <p>To finish and what everyone is wondering, where does the K1 key come from? Easy, the flame flickers but you have to insert the candle. We group the plain text: </p>
         <img src="../assets/k3_palimpcest.jpg"/>

<h3>K1</h3>
         <p>It is made up of the first 63 characters, the key is palimpsest, which refers to a manuscript that preserves traces of another previous writing in the same 
             surface, but expressly erased to give way to what now exists. It is deciphered with Vigenère although not with the table that Jim gives us. The table used in the upper header begins with kryptos and in row A ends with kryptos,
             encrypting Z with A gives S. Here the clues end stand out as indicating positions of the word kryptos and T IS YOUR POSITION so that the last rows of encryption T...YP matches with the Vigenère table that is used where the row of the T ends in YP.  </p>
          <p>In decryption we see an error in iQlusion, if we use S when decrypting but if we use C we see illusion. With S the coded letter would be W. The text tells us about shadows and absence of light (darkness), in addition to being or lying the nuance (double meaning in English) of the illusion or of the Q and the C?
          In an observant way you can read between s and t or between s and a or between g and t or between g and a or between ing (final ingq of K3) and abs (abscissa).
          </p>
  <h3>K2</h3>
             <p>The key of K2 is taken from the plaintext of K1 and palimpsest using the Vigenère table of K1, if we use the morse words allyinvisible we obtain the keyword abscissa. It tells us about transmitting information using the Earth's magnetic field. It gives us some 
             coordinates, which supposedly corresponded to the place where an American USGS was buried.  Towards the end of the text Jim removed an S in the cipher and the end is decrypted as IDBYROWS (identified by rows?) although it is actually XLAYERTWO.</p>
             <p>If we place the plain text of K2 in rows of 8 characters, at the end it reads TWO OXO in the shape of an L. </p>
             <h3>Let's start playing</h3>
             <p> Jim has given some K4 plaintext words like BERLINCLOCK and EASTNORTHEAST. He also commented that we should investigate more about the Berlin clock. </p>
             <p>The L shape two oxo is striking because it is reminiscent of the 3 in a row and oxo is the nomenclature for oxides. Hot air creates CO2. The C in iqlusion becomes important.</p>
    <p>If in K3 we take the ciphertext without errors (desperately and without q) and decrypt them with the abscissa keyword, openncq, obk and YPCOLCXTS appear. Highlight oppencq.</p>

    <p>There are groupings of three consecutive letters in K3 cipher that appear 2 times and decipher K4 using the K1 table like OIE or MRI. </p>
             <p>If we look closely and place the K3 ciphertext in rows of 31 characters in row 10 we have an L and an F and above these in row 9 and 7 DA and RE respectively, which could correspond to decrypting EA of the first EAST. </p>
             <p>YAR if we turn it around in Morse we have QNR that coincides with N of NORTH in K4.NRQ in code RQ means noise.</p>

    <p>Central European Time or Central European Time or CET is one of the names of the time zone that is 
             one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is used in most European countries and those in North Africa.
Its time offset is UTC+1 during standard time and UTC+2 during summer time.  
(Central European Summer Time, CEST, time to take advantage of sunlight).
        Central European Time or Central European Time is also known by other names, such as Middle European Time. In the past it was known as Berlin time. 

         Maybe palimpCEST is another clue, and the missing S is relevant, 2 layers.
         </p>
    <p>In K4 north, th are decrypted as TWR and HON, request (RQ), the hot air of K3, the answer to the WOnderful question.</p>
             <p>If we catch K2 with the error at the end of removing the encrypted s, and instead of decrypting with abscissa we do it with bscissaa we see playertwo (3 in a row). But if we take the complete ciphertext with s and decrypt it with abscissa,
             We take the text it gives us and decrypt it with bscissaa and so on until we do it with cissaabs, we see that clockr appears. Which could be lock r.</p>
     <img src="../assets/kryptos/clockr_k2.jpg"/>
    <p>A second OXO is also seen in K2 in the plain text.</p>
    <img src="../assets/kryptos/segundo_oxo_k2.jpg"/>

    <p>If we look at plain K2 without errors and see that O-QX-TWO appears inserted in K4 as a cipher.</p>
             <p>If we try to decrypt K2 without errors with encrypted K4 as the key, at the end we see qqrth, which attracts attention. However, it does not match the encryption in K4 in the north position, perhaps because the encrypted K4 must be reordered to use it as key.</p>
             <p>If we take K2 encrypted without errors and use candle as the key to decrypt, pairs of K4 plain key encrypted characters begin to appear. If we remove some characters and apply successive decryptions, pairs appear but we do not arrive at a complete text. Here we highlight the pattern of YA_R, the O2 to OCO (CO2) that passes to X and the RQ of NRQ. If this is the way to decrypt, we need to know precisely which letter to remove or how to move the letters.</p>
             <img src="../assets/kryptos/k2_candle.jpg"/>

<p>If we place the encrypted K1 in rows of 18 characters, we begin to decrypt, we see in the last column ILO, if we take that text and decrypt it with alimpsestp we see that it begins with RQIOBOBKL, if we continue substituting by moving letters of the key in In the last column we have DKO, which coincides in K4 with DKO-OLI.</p>
             <p>Several things stand out in K4, the first is Q?OBKR. It resembles lock of clock. If we look at decrypting clock in K4, CBAQK appears, which is like back, and the Q appears in the middle. Note that the end of K4 is KCAR. It appears next to BERLINCLOCK. CLOCK contains lock, close.  If we look at kryptos visually it seems that there are two inverted keys. 
             In Berlin there is a key that when we open a door we can only recover the key by closing it. This key is inserted, turned, pushed a little more, turned from the other side and pulled from the opposite side to where it was inserted. There were also doors on the Berlin Wall that had two locks and needed two different keys and two people to open. Maybe clock is an intentional error instead of block. </p>
            
         <p>Words in K3 such as ENCUMBERED AMBER and TREMBLING are also striking, they remind us of Berlin. </p>
         <p>The end of K3 and berlinclock is reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendlerblock">Bendlerblock</a>.</p>
