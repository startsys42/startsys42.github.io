        <h1>Kryptos</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Kryptos is a sculpture by sculptor Jim Sanborn that has been installed in the CIA offices in Langley since 1990.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>K0</h3>
<p>The first thing to solve is the morse code or K0. Once solved, several things stand out.</p>
<p>The placement of the words, left to right and from top to bottom and from right to left and from bottom to top.</p>
<p>The e is the most used letter in English.</p>
<p>The existence of the palindrome in interpretation.</p>
<p>Morse itself, its structure and design. Playing with dots, two letters give rise to one. As GT forms Q. Also three dots form a line.</p>
<p>We forces e, which can be interpreted as f or c, w for c, e for c.</p>
<p>Digital, dig is to extract, if we remove a dot from the i in morse it becomes an e.</p>
<p>T is your position, tposition can mean transposition. Or t is y or t is your p. </p>
<p>SOS stresses the importance of Morse code.</p>
<p>RQ could mean request but also the radio codes RQ, back to Morse code.</p>
<p>The placement of T IS, SOS and RQ stands out, the pyramid they form. It should be noted that IOQ is vigenère, which will be seen later.</p>
<p>Finally, the number of letters e stands out, as if something had been extracted or moved back.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>In the sculpture it stands out that a vigenère table is shown, this table has an alphabet of 31 letters except for the letter N which has 32, 
             highlighting an L. The word he uses is kryptos, which means secret. It stands out that if we take 26 letters of the alphabet, the following ones are like reversing the meaning. 
             Although it shows this table, it is not the one used to decrypt K1 and K2. Note that the alphabet rotates (go back) one position in each letter.</p>
      <p> If we grouped the encrypted message from the letters END to the end into 14 rows of 31 characters we began to see things.</p>
      <p> The word END and DOT  appear. Below we see TWO, L-shaped OXO, AIR and KRSO(T)YP (kryptos) as indicating a transposition or change of order or direction. PGP also appears (Sanborn and the CIA knew
                    of its existence before being published?) and KR (private part) and KU (public part).</p>
    <p>We can see words like STEW, SITE (sitego, stego), HARD placed in column in the ciphertext and DIG. </p>
      <p>The grouping of 3 T vertically and the vertical XTT in the lower corner stands out.</p>
      <p>If we look closely at all the cipher text at the top and bottom we see a key but in the opposite direction. </p>

      <p> In the upper left corner from the END we see ENDYAHR where the letters YA_R are raised. It can be read as HR A DY (hours in a day), as YEAR, as the initials of yellow, amber, red, or as a pattern.</p>
<h3>K3</h3>
         <p>In my opinion, this is the next fragment to decrypt. It is a transposition that goes from the E of the END to the last ?. First group the letters into rows with a total of 24 characters per row and
             then turns them counterclockwise. Next, form lines of 8 characters and turn again in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>The text is a fragment of Howard Carter's diary notes upon discovering Tutankhamun's tomb.</p>
         <p>If we calmly analyze the text, we see that it tries to tell us something more than a way to proceed. The text seems to be missing a letter E, has an extra Q and there is an A instead 
             of an E in DESPARATLY.</p>
      <p>It talks about removing debris from the bottom of the door, although doorway is door in English, it can also be portal, entrance or step. If we separate door (entrance) and way, way means by itself the form, the path or the mode or the manner.

Remains  can be interpreted as remain (remain, stay, be)-(S). Main means main, major, important or master (-S) and mains means electric network.</p>
