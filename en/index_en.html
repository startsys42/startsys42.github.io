        <h1>What is Startsys?</h1>
<p> Startsys is a project aimed at researching a set of technologies and arts.
    And perhaps one day become a company dedicated to technological research, hosting and event organization.</p>
        <br>
          <br>
        <h1>What are those technologies?</h1>
<p>Within the project, in addition to services and servers, it would be good to investigate topics related to robotics and home automation (drones, smart hydroponics, etc.), video games and security.</p>     
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>What are the next steps?</h1>
       <p>
 <ul>
            <li>Setting up our own server.</li>
      
        <li>Create social networks.</li>
        <li>Study English (we will try to reach as wide an audience as possible).</li>
       <li>Study topics related to audiovisuals such as sound production, film and 3D design.</li>
<li>Study video game production.</li>
<li>Study cryptography and steganography.</li>
<li>Study other disciplines that we can use for our events such as painting...</li>  
        </ul>
           
       </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>What types of events can be expected?</h1>
      <p>Well, it would be interesting, in addition to video games, to create challenges of different kinds. For example, we have pixel-war, who wants to be a millionaire, do you know more than a primary school child and ... interesting!!</p>
